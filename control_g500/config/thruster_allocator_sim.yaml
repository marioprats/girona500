# Velocity and pose controller.
# - Current pose and velocity are provided by the Navigator or the Dynamics Node
# - The setpoint is provided by the Coordinator Node. By default, degrees X, Y, Z and Yaw are velocities while Roll and Pitch are Positions
# - The output is sent to the actuators that can be thrusters or fins
